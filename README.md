# belly-button-challenge
Good God, this was annoying. But thanks to Nathan Rosenberg for assistance, especially with having the bonus commented out!
Our belly buttons are rich in bacteria. More than 70% of those bacteria, or OTUs, are of only a handful of species.
Via D3 we read a JSON of these cultures and their hosts; we then use Plotly to display bar and bubble charts for each host.
This is interactive; we also create a dropdown menu that adjusts the graphs according to a user's selected host. A panel also indicates additional information about all hosts in the JSON.
